# Nuntly TypeScript SDK Examples

This directory contains runnable examples demonstrating how to use the [Nuntly TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/nuntly/nuntly-sdk-typescript).

## Running Examples

Each example is a standalone script. To run an example:

```sh
# Make the script executable (if not already)
chmod +x examples/<your-example>.ts

# Run the example using tsn (TypeScript Node runner)
yarn tsn -T examples/<your-example>.ts
```

Or, you can run with `npx`:

```sh
npx tsx examples/<your-example>.ts
```
